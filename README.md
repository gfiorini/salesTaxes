# salesTaxes

Exercise input is provided hardcoded in unit test class TestSalesTaxes

testReceipt1 validates exercise Input/Output 1 

testReceipt2 validates exercise Input/Output 2

testReceipt3 validates exercise Input/Output 3

I changed input 3 line "box of imported chocolates" to "imported box of chocolates" because i think it is a typo.
